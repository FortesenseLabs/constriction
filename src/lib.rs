//! Entropy coding primitives in Rust for Rust and/or Python.
//!
//! This crate provides high-performance generic lossless compression primitives.
//! Its main intended use case is for building more specialized lossless or lossy
//! compression methods on top of these primitives. For this reason, the library can
//! be used both as a standard Rust crate that one can include in other rust
//! projects, or one can (optionally) compile this crate as a [Python extension
//! module] (using `cargo build --release --feature pybindings`). This allows users
//! to quickly experiment in Python with different compression methods that build on
//! top of the primitives provided by this library. Once a promising compression
//! method has been developed, one can implement an optimized version of the method
//! in Rust building on the same entropy coding primitives provided by this crate.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Rust users will likely want to start by encoding some data with a [`Coder`].
//!
//! Python users will likely want to install this library via `pip install
//! constriction`, then `import constriction` in their project and construct a
//! `constriction.Coder`.
//!
//! # A Primer on Entropy Coding
//!
//! Entropy coding is an approach to lossless compression that employs a
//! probabilistic model over the encoded data. This so called *entropy model* allows
//! an entropy coding algorithm to assign short codewords to data it will likely
//! see, at the cost of mapping unlikely data to longer codewords. The module
//! [`distributions`] provides tools to construct entropy models that you can use
//! with a [`Coder`] or a [`SeekableDecoder`].
//!
//! The information theoretically optimal (i.e., lowest possible) *expected* bitrate
//! for entropy coding lies within one bit of the [cross entropy] of the employed
//! entropy model relative to the true distribution of the encoded data. To achieve
//! this optimal expected bitrate, an optimal entropy coder has to map each possible
//! data point to a compressed bitstring whose length is the [information content]
//! of the data under the entropy model (rounded up to the nearest integer).
//!
//! The entropy coders provided by this library are *asymptotically optimal* in the
//! sense that they employ approximations to optimize for runtime performance, but
//! these approximations can be adjusted via generic parameters to get arbitrarily
//! close to the information theoretically optimal compression performance (in the
//! limit of large data). The documentation of `Coder` has a [section discussing the
//! involved tradeoffs](struct.Coder.html#guidance-for-choosing-w-and-precision).
//!
//! ## Streaming Entropy Coding
//!
//! The entropy coders provided in this library support what is called "streaming
//! entropy coding" over a sequence of symbols. This provides better compression
//! performance (lower bitrates) on large data than well-known alternative methods
//! such as [Huffman coding], which do not support streaming entropy coding.
//!
//! To understand the problem that streaming entropy coding solves, one has to look
//! at practical applications of entropy coding. Data compression is only useful if
//! one a large amount of data, typically represented as a long sequence of
//! *symbols* (such as a long sequence of characters when compressing a text
//! document). Conceptually, the entropy model is then a probability distribution
//! over the entire sequence of symbols (e.g, a probability distribution over all
//! possible text documents). In practice, however, dealing with probability
//! distributions over large amounts of data is difficult, and one therefore
//! typically factorizes the entropy model into individual models for each symbol
//! (such a factorization still allows for [modeling correlations](
//! #encoding-correlated-data) as discussed below).
//!
//! Such a factorization of the entropy model would lead to a significant overhead
//! (in bitrate) in some of the original entropy coding algorithms such as [Huffman
//! coding]. This is because Huffman coding compresses each symbol into its
//! individual bitstring. The compressed representation of the entire message is
//! then formed by concatenating the compressed bitstrings of each symbol (the
//! bitstrings are formed in a way that makes delimiters unnecessary). This has an
//! important drawback: each symbol contributes an integer number of bits to the
//! compressed data, even if its [information content] is not an integer number,
//! which is the common case (the information content of a symbol is the symbol's
//! contribution to the length of the compressed bitstring in an *optimal* entropy
//! coder). For example, consider the problem of compressing a sequence of one
//! million symbols, where the average information content of each symbol is
//! 0.1&nbsp;bits (this is a realistic scenario for neural compression methods).
//! While the information content of the entire message is only 1,000,000 Ã— 0.1 =
//! 100,000&nbsp;bits, Huffman coding would need at least one full bit for each
//! symbol, resulting in a compressed bitstring that is at least ten times longer.
//!
//! The entropy coders provided by this library do not suffer from this overhead
//! because they support *streaming* entropy coding, which amortizes over the
//! information content of several symbols. In the above example, this library would
//! produce a compressed bitstring that is closer to 100,000&nbsp;bits in length
//! (the remaining overhead depends on details in the choice of entropy coder used,
//! which generally trades off compression performance against runtime and memory
//! performance). This amortization over symbols means that one can no longer map
//! each symbol to a span of bits in the compressed bitstring. Therefore, jumping
//! ("seeking") to a given position in the compressed bitstring in a
//! [`SeekableDecoder`] requires providing some small additional information aside
//! from the jump address. The additional information can be thought of as the
//! fractional (i.e., sub-bit) part of the jump address
//!
//! # Encoding Correlated Data
//!
//! The above mentioned factorization of the entropy model into individual models
//! for each encoded symbol may seem more restrictive than it actually is. It is not
//! to be confused with a "fully factorized" model, which is not required here. The
//! entropy model can still model correlations between different symbols in a
//! message.
//!
//! The most straight-forward way to encode correlations is by choosing the entropy
//! model of each symbol conditionally on other symbols ("autoregressive" entropy
//! models), as described in the example below. Another way to encode correlations
//! is via hierarchical probabilistic models and the bits-back algorithm, which can
//! naturally be implemented on top of a stack-based entropy coder such as the rANS
//! coder provided by this library.
//!
//! For an example of an autoregressive entropy model, consider the task of
//! compressing a message that consists of a sequence of three symbols
//! `[s1, s2, s3]`. The full entropy model for this message is a probability
//! distribution `p(s1, s2, s3)`. Such a distribution can, at least in principle,
//! always be factorized as `p(s1, s2, s3) = p1(s1) * p2(s2 | s1) *
//! p3(s3 | s1, s2)`. Here, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are entropy models for the
//! individual symbols `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, respectively. In this notation, the bar
//! "`|`" separates the symbol on the left, which is the one that the given entropy
//! model describes, from the symbols on the right, which one must already know if
//! one wants to construct the entropy model.
//!
//! During encoding, we know the entire message `[s1, s2, s3]`, and so we can
//! construct all three entropy models `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. We then use these
//! entropy models to encode the symbols `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` (in reverse order if a
//! stack-based entropy coding algorithm such as rANS is used). When decoding the
//! compressed bitstring, we do not know the symbols `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` upfront,
//! so we initially cannot construct `p2` or `p3`. But the entropy model `p1` of the
//! first symbol does not depend on any other symbols, so we can use it to decode
//! the first symbol `s1`. Using this decoded symbol, we can construct the entropy
//! model `p2` and use it to decode the second symbol `s2`. Finally, we use both
//! decoded symbols `s1` and `s2` to construct the entropy model `p3` and we decode
//! `s3`.
//!
//! This technique of autoregressive models can be scaled up to build very
//! expressive entropy models over complex data types. This is outside the scope of
//! this library, which only provides the primitive building blocks for constructing
//! [`distributions`] over individual symbols and for encoding and decoding data.
