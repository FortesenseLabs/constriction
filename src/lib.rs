//! Entropy coding primitives in Rust for Rust and/or Python.
//!
//! This crate provides high-performance generic lossless compression primitives.
//! Its main intended use case is for building more specialized lossless or lossy
//! compression methods on top of these primitives. For this reason, the library can
//! be used both as a standard Rust crate that one can include in other rust
//! projects, or one can (optionally) compile this crate as a [Python extension
//! module] (using `cargo build --release --feature pybindings`). This allows users
//! to quickly experiment in Python with different compression methods that build on
//! top of the primitives provided by this library. Once a promising compression
//! method has been developed, one can implement an optimized version of the method
//! in Rust building on the same entropy coding primitives provided by this crate.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Rust users will likely want to start by encoding some data with a [`Coder`].
//!
//! Python users will likely want to install this library via `pip install
//! streamcode`, then `import streamcode` in their project and construct a
//! `streamcode.Coder`.
//!
//! # A Primer on Entropy Coding
//!
//! Entropy coding is an approach to lossless compression that employs a
//! probabilistic model over the encoded data. This so called *entropy model* allows
//! an entropy coding algorithm to assign short codewords to data it will likely
//! see, at the cost of mapping unlikely data to longer codewords. The module
//! [`distributions`] provides tools to construct entropy models that you can use
//! with a [`Coder`] or a [`SeekableDecoder`].
//!
//! The information theoretically optimal (i.e., lowest possible) *expected* bitrate
//! for entropy coding lies within one bit of the [cross entropy] of the employed
//! entropy model relative to the true distribution of the encoded data. To achieve
//! this optimal expected bitrate, an optimal entropy coder has to map each possible
//! data point to a compressed bitstring whose length is the [information content]
//! of the data under the entropy model (rounded up to the nearest integer).
//!
//! The entropy coders provided by this library are *asymptotically optimal* in the
//! sense that they employ approximations to optimize for runtime performance, but
//! these approximations can be adjusted via generic parameters to get arbitrarily
//! close to the information theoretically optimal compression performance (in the
//! limit of large data). The documentation of `Coder` has a [section discussing the
//! involved tradeoffs](struct.Coder.html#guidance-for-choosing-w-and-precision).
//!
//! ## Streaming Entropy Coding
//!
//! The entropy coders provided in this library support what is called "streaming
//! entropy coding" over a sequence of symbols. This provides better compression
//! performance (lower bitrates) on large data than well-known alternative methods
//! such as [Huffman coding], which do not support streaming entropy coding.
//!
//! To understand the problem that streaming entropy coding solves, one has to look
//! at practical applications of entropy coding. Data compression is only useful if
//! one a large amount of data, typically represented as a long sequence of
//! *symbols* (such as a long sequence of characters when compressing a text
//! document). Conceptually, the entropy model is then a probability distribution
//! over the entire sequence of symbols (e.g, a probability distribution over all
//! possible text documents). In practice, however, dealing with probability
//! distributions over large amounts of data is difficult, and one therefore
//! typically factorizes the entropy model into individual models for each symbol
//! (such a factorization still allows for [modeling correlations](
//! #encoding-correlated-data) as discussed below).
//!
//! Such a factorization of the entropy model would lead to a significant overhead
//! (in bitrate) in some of the original entropy coding algorithms such as [Huffman
//! coding]. This is because Huffman coding compresses each symbol into its
//! individual bitstring. The compressed representation of the entire message is
//! then formed by concatenating the compressed bitstrings of each symbol (the
//! bitstrings are formed in a way that makes delimiters unnecessary). This has an
//! important drawback: each symbol contributes an integer number of bits to the
//! compressed data, even if its [information content] is not an integer number,
//! which is the common case (the information content of a symbol is the symbol's
//! contribution to the length of the compressed bitstring in an *optimal* entropy
//! coder). For example, consider the problem of compressing a sequence of one
//! million symbols, where the average information content of each symbol is
//! 0.1&nbsp;bits (this is a realistic scenario for neural compression methods).
//! While the information content of the entire message is only 1,000,000 Ã— 0.1 =
//! 100,000&nbsp;bits, Huffman coding would need at least one full bit for each
//! symbol, resulting in a compressed bitstring that is at least ten times longer.
//!
//! The entropy coders provided by this library do not suffer from this overhead
//! because they support *streaming* entropy coding, which amortizes over the
//! information content of several symbols. In the above example, this library would
//! produce a compressed bitstring that is closer to 100,000&nbsp;bits in length
//! (the remaining overhead depends on details in the choice of entropy coder used,
//! which generally trades off compression performance against runtime and memory
//! performance). This amortization over symbols means that one can no longer map
//! each symbol to a span of bits in the compressed bitstring. Therefore, jumping
//! ("seeking") to a given position in the compressed bitstring in a
//! [`SeekableDecoder`] requires providing some small additional information aside
//! from the jump address. The additional information can be thought of as the
//! fractional (i.e., sub-bit) part of the jump address
//!
//! # Encoding Correlated Data
//!
//! The above mentioned factorization of the entropy model into individual models
//! for each encoded symbol may seem more restrictive than it actually is. It is not
//! to be confused with a "fully factorized" model, which is not required here. The
//! entropy model can still model correlations between different symbols in a
//! message.
//!
//! The most straight-forward way to encode correlations is by choosing the entropy
//! model of each symbol conditionally on other symbols ("autoregressive" entropy
//! models), as described in the example below. Another way to encode correlations
//! is via hierarchical probabilistic models and the bits-back algorithm, which can
//! naturally be implemented on top of a stack-based entropy coder such as the rANS
//! coder provided by this library.
//!
//! For an example of an autoregressive entropy model, consider the task of
//! compressing a message that consists of a sequence of three symbols
//! `[s1, s2, s3]`. The full entropy model for this message is a probability
//! distribution `p(s1, s2, s3)`. Such a distribution can, at least in principle,
//! always be factorized as `p(s1, s2, s3) = p1(s1) * p2(s2 | s1) *
//! p3(s3 | s1, s2)`. Here, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are entropy models for the
//! individual symbols `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, respectively. In this notation, the bar
//! "`|`" separates the symbol on the left, which is the one that the given entropy
//! model describes, from the symbols on the right, which one must already know if
//! one wants to construct the entropy model.
//!
//! During encoding, we know the entire message `[s1, s2, s3]`, and so we can
//! construct all three entropy models `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. We then use these
//! entropy models to encode the symbols `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` (in reverse order if a
//! stack-based entropy coding algorithm such as rANS is used). When decoding the
//! compressed bitstring, we do not know the symbols `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` upfront,
//! so we initially cannot construct `p2` or `p3`. But the entropy model `p1` of the
//! first symbol does not depend on any other symbols, so we can use it to decode
//! the first symbol `s1`. Using this decoded symbol, we can construct the entropy
//! model `p2` and use it to decode the second symbol `s2`. Finally, we use both
//! decoded symbols `s1` and `s2` to construct the entropy model `p3` and we decode
//! `s3`.
//!
//! This technique of autoregressive models can be scaled up to build very
//! expressive entropy models over complex data types. This is outside the scope of
//! this library, which only provides the primitive building blocks for constructing
//! [`distributions`] over individual symbols and for encoding and decoding data.

/// The `Coder` uses an entropy coding algorithm called [range Asymmetric

/// # Generic Parameters: Compressed Word Type `W` and `PRECISION`
///
/// The `Coder` is generic over a type `W`, which is a [`CompressedWord`], and over
/// a constant `PRECISION` of type `usize`. **If you're unsure how to set these
/// parameters, consider using the type alias [`DefaultCoder`], which uses sane
/// default values.**
///
/// ## Meaning of `W` and `PRECISION`
///
/// If you need finer control over the entropy coder, and [`DefaultCoder`] does not
/// fit your needs, then here are the details about the parameters `W` and
/// `PRECISION`:
///
/// - `W` is the smallest "chunk" of compressed data. It is usually a primitive
///   unsigned integer type, such as `u32` or `u16`. The type `W` is also used to
///   represent probabilities in fixed-point arithmetic in any
///   [`DiscreteDistribution`] that can be employed as an entropy model for this
///   `Coder` (however, when representing probabilities, only use the lowest
///   `PRECISION` bits of a `W` are ever used).
///
///   The `Coder` operates on an internal state whose size is twice as large as `W`.
///   When encoding data, the `Coder` keeps filling up this internal state with
///   compressed data until it is about to overflow. Just before the internal state
///   would overflow, the coder chops off half of it and pushes one "compressed
///   word" of type `W` onto a dynamically growable and shrinkable buffer of `W`s.
///   Once all data is encoded, the encoder chops the final internal state into two
///   `W`s, pushes them onto the buffer, and returns the buffer as the compressed
///   data (see method [`into_compressed`]).
///
/// - `PRECISION` defines the number of bits that the entropy models use for
///   fixed-point representation of probabilities. `PRECISION` must be positive and
///   no larger than the bitlength of `W` (e.g., if `W` is `u32` then we must have
///   `1 <= PRECISION <= 32`).
///
///   Since the smallest representable probability is `(1/2)^PRECISION`, the largest
///   possible (finite) [information content of a single symbol is `PRECISION`
///   bits. Thus, pushing a single symbol onto the `Coder` increases the "filling
///   level" of the `Coder`'s internal state by at most `PRECISION` bits. Since
///   `PRECISION` is at most the bitlength of `W`, the procedure of transferring one
///   `W` from the internal state to the buffer described in the list item above is
///   guaranteed to free up enough internal state to encode at least one additional
///   symbol.
///
/// ## Guidance for Choosing `W` and `PRECISION`
///
/// If you choose `W` and `PRECISION` manually (rather than using a
/// [`DefaultCoder`]), then your choice should take into account the following
/// considerations:
///
/// - Set `PRECISION` to a high enough value so that you can approximate your
///   entropy models sufficiently well. If you have a very precise entropy model of
///   your data in your mind, then choosing a low `PRECISION` won't allow you to
///   represent this entropy model very accurately, thus leading to a mismatch
///   between the used entropy model and the true distribution of the encoded data.
///   This will lead to a *linear* overhead in bitrate (i.e., an overhead that is
///   proportional to the number of encoded symbols).
/// - Depending on the entropy models used, a high `PRECISION` may be more expensive
///   in terms of runtime and memory requirements. If this is a concern, then don't
///   set `PRECISION` too high. In particular, a [`LookupDistribution`] allocates  
///   memory on the order of `O(2^PRECISION)`, i.e., *exponential* in `PRECISION`.
/// - Since `W` must be at least `PRECISION` bits in size, a high `PRECISION` means
///   that you will have to use a larger `W` type. This has several consequences:
///   - it affects the size of the internal state of the coder; this is relevant if
///     you want to store many different internal states, e.g., as a jump table for
///     a [`SeekableDecoder`].
///   - it leads to a small *constant* overhead in bitrate: since the `Coder`
///     operates on an internal  state of two `W`s, it has a constant bitrate
///     overhead between zero and two `W`s depending on the filling level of the
///     internal state. This constant  overhead is usually negligible unless you
///     want to compress a very small amount of data.
///   - the choice of `W` may have some effect on runtime performance since
///     operations on larger types may be more expensive (remember that the `Coder`
///     operates on a state of twice the size as `W`, i.e., if `W = u64` then the
///     coder will operate on a `u128`, which may be slow on some hardware). On the
///     other hand, this overhead should not be used as an argument for setting `W`
///     to a very small type like `u8` or `u16` since common computing architectures
///     are usually not really faster on very small registers, and a very small `W`
///     type will lead to more frequent transfers between the internal state and the
///     growable buffer, which requires potentially expensive branching and memory
///     lookups.
/// - Finally, the "slack" between `PRECISION` and the size of `W` has an influence
///   on the bitrate. It is usually *not* a good idea to set `PRECISION` to the
///   highest value allowed for a given `W` (e.g., setting `W = u32` and
///   `PRECISION = 32` is *not* recommended). This is because, when encoding a
///   symbol, the `Coder` expects there to be at least `PRECISION` bits of entropy
///   in its internal state (conceptually, encoding a symbol `s` consists of
///   consuming `PRECISION` bits of entropy followed by pushing
///   `PRECISION + information_content(s)` bits of entropy onto the internal state).
///   If `PRECISION` is set to the full size of `W` then there will be relatively
///   frequent situations where the internal state contains less than `PRECISION`
///   bits of entropy, leading to an overhead (this situation will typically arise
///   after the `Coder` transferred a `W` from the internal state to the growable
///   buffer).
///
/// The type alias [`DefaultCoder`] was chose with the above considerations in mind.
///
/// # Consistency Between Encoding and Decoding
///
/// As elaborated in the [crate documentation](index.html#streaming-entropy-coding),
/// encoding and decoding operates on a sequence of symbols. Each symbol can be
/// encoded and decoded with its own entropy model (the symbols can even have
/// heterogeneous types). If your goal is to reconstruct the originally encoded
/// symbols during decoding, then you must employ the same sequence of entropy
/// models (in reversed order) during encoding and decoding.
///
/// However, using the same entropy models for encoding and decoding is not a
/// *general* requirement. It is perfectly legal to push (encode) symbols on the
/// `Coder` using some entropy models, and then pop off (decode) symbols using
/// different entropy models. The popped off symbols will then in general be
/// different from the original symbols, but will be generated in a deterministic
/// way. If there is no deterministic relation between the entropy models used for
/// pushing and popping, and if there is still compressed data left at the end
/// (i.e., if [`is_empty`] returns false), then the popped off symbols are
/// approximately distributed as independent samples from the respective entropy
/// models. Such random samples, which consume parts of the compressed data, are
/// useful in the bits-back algorithm.
